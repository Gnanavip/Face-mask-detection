# üõ°Ô∏è Face Mask Detection

A **real-time AI-powered face mask detection system** built using **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and MobileNetV2**.  
This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask in live video streams or images, helping monitor public mask compliance during situations like COVID-19.
